An (ideally) single-consumer single-producer bip buffer, implemented in two header files.

Essentially a reimplementation of James Munns' bbqueue in *gasp* C ([linked here](https://github.com/jamesmunns/bbqueue))

Simon Cooke introducted the bip-buffer nearly 20 years ago.
[Read about the bip-buffer data structure here](https://www.codeproject.com/articles/3479/the-bip-buffer-the-circular-buffer-with-a-twist)

Run make tests to compile the test programs.
